1. **Creating the Database and Tables**
2. **Inserting Sample Data**
3. **Writing Basic and Advanced Queries**
4. **Creating Views for Common Queries**
5. **Creating Stored Procedures for Reusable Logic (Soon)**
6. **Creating Triggers for Automating Data Updates (Soon)**


## Reports
- `top_selling_products_report.sql`: Report on top-selling products.
- `most_valuable_customers_report.sql`: Report on most valuable customers.
- `monthly_sales_trends_report.sql`: Report on monthly sales trends.
